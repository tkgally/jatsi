<details> <summary>Summary</summary> <p class="jatsi_summary"><i>A Visit to India, China, and Japan in the Year 1853</i> chronicles Bayard Taylor's extensive travels across three continents, offering insights into the cultures, landscapes, and political climates of the regions he visited. The book is divided into three distinct sections, each focusing on a specific country: India, China, and Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Taylor's journey through India takes him from Bombay to Agra and Delhi, where he marvels at the architectural wonders of the Mughal Empire, including the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort. He then ventures into the Himalayas, reaching Landour and experiencing the stark beauty and unique cultural practices of the paharrees. His travels continue through Cawnpore and Lucknow, offering glimpses into the complexities of British rule and the opulent, yet corrupt, court of the Nawabs of Oude. His Indian sojourn concludes with visits to Allahabad and Benares, centers of Hindu pilgrimage and religious devotion.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">In China, Taylor focuses primarily on Shanghai, where he observes the growing tensions between the Chinese authorities and the Taiping Rebellion. His journal entries capture the uncertainty and anticipation surrounding the rebellion's potential impact on foreign residents. He also explores the cultural and social landscape of Shanghai, noting the stark contrast between the opulent lifestyles of foreign residents and the poverty and squalor of the native population. His observations of Chinese customs and practices reveal a deep-seated cultural divide and a lack of understanding between the two groups.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The Japan section of the book details Taylor's experience as part of the U.S. Perry Expedition, tasked with opening Japan to trade and diplomatic relations with the West. Taylor provides a firsthand account of the negotiations with Japanese officials, highlighting Commodore Perry's firm and resolute approach, which contrasts with the evasive tactics employed by the Japanese. The expedition successfully secures permission to land and deliver the President's letter, marking a significant step in establishing diplomatic relations between the two nations.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Taylor's descriptions of the Japanese landscape and people challenge prevailing Western perceptions of Japan as a barbaric and uncivilized nation. He emphasizes the beauty and tranquility of the Bay of Yedo, the advanced state of Japanese agriculture, and the refined manners and intelligence of Japanese officials. His observations offer a nuanced perspective on a nation that had been largely isolated from the outside world for centuries. He concludes his account with a sense of optimism regarding the potential for future trade and cultural exchange between the United States and Japan.</p> <button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button> </details>

<details> <summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Richard Hildreth's <i>Japan as It Was and Is</i> is a two-volume historical compilation of European writings on Japan from the 13th to the 19th centuries. The first volume primarily focuses on the early encounters and interactions between European explorers, traders, and missionaries with Japan, particularly during the 16th and 17th centuries. Hildreth begins with the accounts of Marco Polo and the Mongol invasion of Japan in the 13th century and then delves into the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, marking the beginning of significant European contact. He extensively covers the activities of Portuguese missionaries, especially the Jesuits, and their efforts to spread Christianity in Japan, facing challenges from both local religious groups and internal political conflicts.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The first volume also details the emergence of the Dutch and English as competitors to the Portuguese in Japanese trade. Hildreth provides comprehensive narratives of early Dutch and English voyages to Japan, highlighting the experiences of individuals like William Adams, an English pilot who played a crucial role in establishing Dutch trade relations. Additionally, the book explores the complex political landscape of Japan during this period, with its feudal system and the rise of powerful figures like Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who unified the country under a central authority. The volume concludes with the gradual decline and eventual expulsion of the Portuguese, leaving the Dutch as the sole European trading partners with Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The second volume of <i>Japan as It Was and Is</i> shifts its focus to the experiences and observations of European visitors to Japan during the 18th and 19th centuries, a period marked by Japan's self-imposed isolation. Hildreth draws heavily on the works of Engelbert Kämpfer, a German physician and naturalist who resided in Japan in the late 17th century, providing detailed descriptions of Japanese society, culture, and governance. He subsequently examines the accounts of later Dutch visitors, such as Carl Peter Thunberg and Isaac Titsingh, who offer insights into the continuity and evolution of Japanese life during this era of seclusion. The book delves into various aspects of Japanese society, including religion, customs, art, architecture, and the lives of different social classes.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The latter part of the second volume explores the increasing pressure from Western powers to end Japan's isolation policy in the 19th century. Hildreth chronicles the attempts by Russia, England, and the United States to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with Japan. He details the unsuccessful missions of early envoys and the eventual success of Commodore Matthew Perry's expedition in 1853-1854, which resulted in the Treaty of Kanagawa and the opening of Japan to limited foreign trade. The volume concludes with the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and several Western countries, marking the beginning of a new era of engagement with the outside world.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Overall, <i>Japan as It Was and Is</i> serves as a valuable historical resource, offering a comprehensive overview of European perspectives on Japan from the 13th to the 19th centuries. Through its compilation of primary sources and historical narratives, the book provides insights into the early encounters, cultural exchanges, and evolving relations between Japan and the West, shedding light on the historical context that shaped Japan's modernization and engagement with the global community.</p>

He also describes the challenges faced by the Americans due to the Japanese government's strict regulations and suspicions of foreigners.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Spalding's account also delves into the cultural and religious aspects of Japan, offering observations on Shinto and Buddhist temples, the role of the clergy, and the unique customs of the Japanese people. He describes the practice of "hari kari" or ritual suicide, the significance of swords in Japanese culture, and the strict social hierarchy that governs their society.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes with the Mississippi's departure from Japan and its subsequent voyages to various locations in the Pacific Ocean, including the Bonin Islands, before ultimately returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope.

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">Notes on the Late Expedition Against the Russian Settlements in Eastern Siberia, and of a Visit to Japan and to the Shores of Tartary, and of the Sea of Okhostk</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">Paul Bernard Whittingham</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924023036050">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book details the experiences of Captain Bernard Whittingham, a Royal Engineer, who joined the British naval expedition against Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia during the Crimean War. The narrative begins in April 1855 as the expedition departs from Hong Kong and sails north towards Japan. Whittingham reflects on the limited knowledge possessed by the British regarding Russia’s expansion in the region and expresses a sense of anticipation for the campaign.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Upon reaching Japan, the expedition first stops at Hakodadi, where Whittingham provides detailed descriptions of the harbour, town, and surrounding countryside. He observes the customs and manners of the Japanese people, noting their respect for authority and their astonishment at Western practices, such as the consumption of meat. Interactions with the local governor and officials highlight the complexities of diplomacy and the challenges of understanding Japanese interpretations of treaty agreements.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The narrative continues as the expedition sails north through the La Perouse Strait and into the Sea of Okhotsk. Encounters with the indigenous Ainu people on Sakhalin Island provide further insights into the region’s cultural diversity and the Russian influence among the native populations. Whittingham describes the Ainu’s bear worship and their observations of Russian ships heading north.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The expedition eventually reaches De Castries Bay, where they discover and briefly engage with a Russian squadron. However, due to the bay’s uncharted waters and the strong defenses of the Russian position, the British are forced to retreat south and await reinforcements. Whittingham expresses his disappointment with the lack of decisive action and criticizes the inadequate intelligence gathering regarding Russian activities in the region.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The remainder of the book covers the expedition’s subsequent movements, including their return to De Castries Bay (finding it deserted), a visit to Ayan (a Russian settlement on the Sea of Okhotsk), and the capture of Russian sailors from the wrecked frigate Diana.

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">The Americans in Japan: An Abridgement of the Government Narrative of the U.S. Expedition to Japan, under Commodore Perry</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">Robert Tomes</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924008787677">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This five-part abridgement details the United States Navy’s expedition to Japan under the command of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1852-1854. The primary objective was to establish diplomatic relations and open Japan to trade with the United States.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The first section describes the journey of the USS Mississippi from Norfolk, Virginia to Shanghai, China, including stops at Madeira, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope. Each location is described in terms of its geography, climate, population, and notable features. At the Cape of Good Hope, the author discusses the ongoing conflict between British colonists and the native Xhosa people.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The second section focuses on Commodore Perry’s arrival and interactions in the Ryukyu Kingdom (present-day Okinawa, Japan). Perry’s squadron anchored at Naha, the principal port, and engaged in extended negotiations with local officials, securing provisions and establishing a coaling station. Tensions arose as Perry insisted on visiting the royal palace at Shuri, a request initially refused due to alleged illness of the Queen Dowager. He ultimately secured permission and conducted a formal visit to the palace and the Regent’s house. An exploration of the island revealed ruins of ancient fortifications and possible evidence of historical connections to India.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The third section narrates the squadron’s arrival in Edo Bay (present-day Tokyo Bay) and the initial interactions with Japanese officials. The Americans anchored near Uraga, closer to the capital than any foreign vessel had previously ventured. Negotiations to deliver a letter from President Fillmore to the Emperor of Japan proved challenging. The Japanese insisted the squadron proceed to Nagasaki, the designated port for foreign contact. Perry refused and, after days of discussions, secured an agreement for a formal meeting at Kurihama. The ceremony involved a large American delegation and two Imperial commissioners who received the President’s letter.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The fourth section describes Perry’s return to Edo Bay after visiting the Bonin Islands and Ryukyu Kingdom. He anchored at Kanagawa, near Yokohama, and further negotiations led to the signing of the Treaty of Kanagawa in March 1854. This treaty opened the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, secured the safety of shipwrecked American sailors, and laid the groundwork for future trade relations. To celebrate the treaty, the Americans and Japanese exchanged gifts and held celebratory feasts.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The fifth section details the experiences of the American squadron at Shimoda and Hakodate. At Shimoda, initial restrictions on movement and interaction with the local population were eventually lifted following protests by Commodore Perry. The author describes the town’s layout, architecture, religious sites, and the surrounding countryside. At Hakodate, the Americans observed the town’s fishing industry, shipbuilding activities, and cultural practices. The section concludes with a brief mention of Commander Adams’ return to Japan in 1855 to exchange the ratified treaty, and the devastating effects of a recent earthquake that severely damaged Shimoda.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/japanopenedcomp00perrgoog">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This 1858 book, <i>Japan Opened,</i> is an account of the American expedition to Japan in 1852-1854 led by Commodore Matthew C. Perry. The book, published by the Religious Tract Society, presents a detailed narrative of the expedition, focusing primarily on the diplomatic efforts involved in establishing trade relations with the historically isolated nation.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The opening chapter provides a historical overview of prior interactions between Japan and Western nations, including Portugal, the Netherlands, England, and Russia. It details the initial openness of the Japanese to foreign contact in the mid-sixteenth century, followed by the eventual expulsion of the Portuguese, primarily due to perceived religious and political threats posed by Catholic missionaries. The chapter further describes the restrictive trade policies enforced upon the Dutch and the various unsuccessful attempts made by other nations to establish commercial relations with Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The narrative then shifts to the genesis of the American expedition, motivated by the growing importance of Japan’s geographical location to expanding trade in the East, the need for safe harbors and coaling stations for American vessels, and specific grievances related to the treatment of American seamen shipwrecked on Japanese shores. The chapter highlights Commodore Perry’s strategy of employing a firm and resolute approach, contrasting it with the more passive strategies of earlier expeditions. It details the initial arrival of the squadron at the Loo Choo islands, the interactions with local authorities, and the eventual establishment of a temporary American presence on shore.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Chapter three chronicles the squadron’s arrival in the Bay of Edo and the subsequent diplomatic interactions with Japanese officials. It underscores Commodore Perry’s insistence on delivering President Fillmore’s letter directly to a high-ranking Japanese official, his refusal to go to Nagasaki, and his determination to secure a favorable response to American demands. The chapter describes the Japanese officials’ attempts to dissuade the Americans from venturing further up the bay, the eventual agreement to receive the letter, and the ceremonial presentation of the document.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The narrative proceeds to detail subsequent negotiations at the treaty house in Yokohama, focusing on the American demands for opening Japanese ports to trade. It highlights the Japanese commissioners’ reluctance to deviate from established policies, their eventual agreement to open the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, and the ongoing discussions regarding the extent of American privileges in those locations. The chapter recounts the exchange of gifts between the two nations, illustrating the Japanese interest in American technology and the efforts made to foster amicable relations.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The final chapter describes Commodore Perry’s departure from Japan and the successful completion of the expedition’s mission. It outlines the signing and ratification of the treaty, the subsequent opening of Japanese ports to other Western nations, and the enduring legacy of the expedition in establishing Japan’s engagement with the international community. The concluding paragraph reflects upon the future prospects for Japan and expresses hope for the spiritual well-being of its people.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary"><i>Japan and Her People</i> is a book by Andrew Steinmetz, published in London in 1859. The book is divided into two parts, the first focusing on the geography, history, and culture of Japan, and the second delving into the historical interactions between Japan and Western nations, particularly the Portuguese, Dutch, and English.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Part one begins with a geographical overview of Japan, describing its islands, climate, and natural resources. It then delves into the country's early history, highlighting the dual system of government with the Mikado and Siogoun, and the rigid societal structure based on hereditary classes. The book explores the Japanese legal system, police regulations, and methods of punishment, contrasting them with European practices.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Steinmetz devotes significant space to the religions of Japan, focusing on Sintooism and Buddhism, including their origins, rituals, and social impact. The book provides detailed descriptions of various religious practices, such as pilgrimages and festivals, and explores the role of priests and nuns within Japanese society.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Steinmetz explores the social and domestic life of the Japanese, discussing their customs, manners, and amusements. He describes their houses, gardens, and modes of transportation, contrasting them with Western equivalents. The book touches upon marriage and funeral ceremonies, highlighting the symbolic significance and societal importance of these events in Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Part two focuses on Japan’s historical interactions with Western nations, beginning with the arrival of the Portuguese in 1542 and the subsequent introduction of Christianity. The book details the rapid spread of the religion and the eventual persecution of Japanese Christians by the government, leading to the expulsion of the Portuguese. It highlights the role of the Dutch in this persecution, criticizing their actions and contrasting them with the more honorable conduct of the English during their earlier attempts to establish trade.

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book chronicles the ten-week journey of Bishop George Smith of Victoria (Hong Kong) through Japan in 1860, shortly after the country opened to foreign trade. It primarily focuses on his experiences in Nagasaki and Kanagawa (including Yokohama), with a significant portion dedicated to his visit to the then-closed capital of Yeddo (Tokyo). He offers observations on the daily life, customs, and religious practices of the Japanese people, drawing frequent comparisons with China, where he had previously served as a missionary.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Smith details the various religious practices he encountered, primarily focusing on the co-existence and blending of the native Shinto religion and the imported Buddhist faith. He describes temple visits, festivals, and interactions with priests, highlighting the devoutness of the general populace and contrasting it with the more skeptical attitude of the educated classes. Additionally, he explores the influence of Confucianism on Japanese society and government, particularly its emphasis on filial piety and obedience to authority.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book delves into various aspects of Japanese life, including funerals, social customs, and public entertainment. Smith dedicates a section to the “Harakiri,” the legalized form of suicide, discussing its cultural significance and the associated rituals. He also describes the prevalence of public bathhouses, the role of women, and the strict social hierarchy that defines Japanese society. Additionally, he touches upon the economic aspects of the country, mentioning agricultural practices, trade, and the difficulties arising from currency exchange with foreigners.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">A significant portion of the book focuses on the political landscape of Japan, particularly the power dynamics between the Shogun (secular emperor), the Daimios (territorial lords), and the Mikado (spiritual emperor). Smith delves into the history of the government, the system of dualism and espionage, and the emerging conflicts between the conservative factions resistant to foreign influence and the more liberal groups open to trade and modernization. He also discusses the complex nature of the Loochoo Islands’ dependency on Japan and their relationship with China.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Smith concludes his account by reflecting on the challenges and opportunities for Christian missions in Japan. He notes the government’s lingering suspicions and the historical legacy of persecution against Christianity, but also acknowledges the potential for positive influence through education and interactions with missionaries. He emphasizes the need for caution and respect for Japanese customs while expressing hope for future progress in opening the country to the Gospel.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book chronicles the travels of Anna D’Almeida and her husband through various locations in Asia, including Manilla, Hong Kong, Macao, Shanghae, and Nagasaki. The narrative primarily focuses on the time period between March and November 1862. While the author does not explicitly state the purpose of their journey, it appears to be a personal exploration of these regions.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book dedicates a significant portion to the Philippines, particularly the island of Luzon and its capital, Manilla. D’Almeida describes the city’s layout, architecture, and customs, including religious processions and the role of the Catholic Church in daily life. She also recounts excursions to nearby towns and villages, offering observations on the lives and habits of the Tagalo people and the mestizos (people of mixed Spanish and Filipino descent).</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Leaving Manilla, the author details her experiences in Hong Kong and Macao, focusing on the natural scenery and historical landmarks. She describes visits to the Happy Valley, Victoria Peak, and Camoens’ Garden, offering a glimpse into the colonial atmosphere of these ports. Additionally, she recounts the tragic murder of Governor Amarals in Macao and the subsequent tensions between the Portuguese authorities and the Chinese population.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The journey continues to Shanghae, where D’Almeida describes the division of the city into European settlements and the native Chinese quarter. She dedicates space to observations on Chinese culture, including religious practices, cuisine, and social customs like marriage and the treatment of women. The presence of the Taiping Rebellion and the involvement of European forces add a layer of political complexity to her observations.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The final leg of the journey takes the author to Nagasaki, Japan. She offers descriptions of the city, its harbor, and surrounding areas, including the infamous Pappenberg Island with its history of Christian persecution. D’Almeida’s observations provide insight into Japanese society, covering topics like clothing, hairdressing, cuisine, and the role of women. While unable to visit the capital, Yeddo (now Tokyo), the author shares her impressions of Japanese culture and customs based on interactions with local residents.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Published in 1863, this travelogue recounts the author’s experiences as a British official tasked with procuring horses for the military campaign in China. The narrative begins with his journey from Hong Kong to Japan aboard an American warship, highlighting the kindness of Commodore Tatnall and his controversial act of aiding British forces during the 1859 Peiho conflict. Upon arriving in Japan, de Fonblanque details his initial impressions of the country and its people, noting their cleanliness, orderliness, and friendliness towards foreigners, particularly in rural areas. He also describes the unique features of Yedo (Tokyo), including the Tycoon’s Palace and the residences of the Daimios.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">A significant portion of the book focuses on de Fonblanque’s efforts to acquire horses in Japan. He describes the challenges he faced due to official interference, cultural differences, and the physical limitations of Japanese horses. He also shares insights into Japanese customs and social norms, including their disregard for modesty, the role of women in society, and their passion for festivals and entertainment. The narrative then takes a darker turn as de Fonblanque recounts the murder of Mr. Alcock’s steward and the subsequent assassination of two Dutch ship captains, highlighting the underlying tensions and anti-European sentiments present in Japan. He provides details of these events and the ineffectual attempts to bring the culprits to justice, emphasizing the challenges faced by foreign representatives in ensuring their safety and asserting their authority.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The author then recounts his experiences during a visit to Fusi-jama (Mount Fuji), undertaken with Mr. Alcock and other members of the British Legation. He describes the breathtaking scenery, the challenges of the ascent, and the cultural significance of the mountain for the Japanese people. Upon returning to Kanagawa, he receives news of the fall of the Taku Forts and the end of the war in China, prompting him to conclude his affairs in Japan and prepare for departure.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The final portion of the book details de Fonblanque’s experiences in northern China, particularly in Tien-tsin and Pekin. He paints a stark contrast between the cleanliness and orderliness of Japan and the squalor and poverty of Chinese cities. He also provides his observations on Chinese culture and society, including their severe legal system, their love of porcelain and jade, and their unique approach to competitive examinations for government positions. The narrative concludes with the death of Emperor Hien Fung and the subsequent coup d’etat orchestrated by Prince Kung, providing insights into the political landscape of China at the time.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">De Fonblanque’s account offers valuable firsthand observations on Japan and China during a pivotal period in their history. While acknowledging the limitations of his knowledge and the potential for inaccuracies, his narrative provides a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities faced by Europeans navigating these complex societies. He refrains from overt judgment or evaluation, presenting his experiences and impressions in a straightforward and objective manner.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book recounts the travels of Robert Fortune, a Scottish botanist and plant collector, through Japan and China in the early 1860s. The narrative begins with Fortune’s arrival in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1860. He details the city’s layout, its inhabitants, and the surrounding countryside, paying particular attention to the gardens and plant life he encounters. He describes the recent opening of Japan to foreigners and the changes it has brought, contrasting the current situation with the strict limitations previously imposed on the Dutch traders confined to the island of Desima.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Fortune then travels to Yokohama and Kanagawa, offering observations on the geological formations, agricultural practices, and plant life of the region. He secures a guide and embarks on several excursions, visiting temples, tea houses, and extensive nursery gardens. These excursions offer insights into Japanese culture, social customs, and the everyday lives of the people. The narrative details Fortune’s journey to Yedo (modern-day Tokyo), where he is hosted by the British Minister and explores the city under the watchful eyes of government officials. He describes Yedo’s layout, its vastness, and the cultural differences he observes between the Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book’s focus then shifts to Fortune’s plant collecting efforts. He visits numerous nursery gardens around Yedo, acquiring many new and exotic species for transport back to England. He utilizes Ward’s cases to ensure the survival of the plants during the long sea voyage. Fortune recounts the challenges faced in transporting the collection, highlighting the reliance on both local knowledge and Western technology to overcome obstacles. After successfully shipping his collection to China for onward passage to England, he returns to Japan in the spring of 1861.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">During his second visit to Japan, Fortune focuses on the changes brought by the changing seasons, detailing the agricultural practices and the diverse flora he observes. He shares his experiences interacting with locals and their reactions to his plant collecting activities. He also discusses the political climate in Japan, particularly the tensions arising from the opening of the country to foreigners and the threat posed by anti-foreign sentiments and assassinations. The book concludes with Fortune’s reflections on the potential of Japan as a source of valuable plants for Western gardens and his concerns about the future stability of the country due to its internal political conflicts and strained relations with foreign powers. He then briefly recounts his subsequent journey to China, visiting Chefoo, Tien-tsin, and Peking, before finally returning to England.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Context and Opening Up of Japan</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Dickson opens by discussing the historical barriers, both geographical and political, that contributed to Japan’s isolation from the rest of the world. He then highlights the role of steam technology and other advancements in breaking down these barriers, leading to increased trade and interaction with Europe. Dickson emphasizes the significant impact of these changes on Japan’s social, religious, and political systems, particularly its feudal structure.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Importance of Understanding Japanese Government</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Dickson argues that understanding the complexities of the Japanese government is crucial for comprehending the changes impacting the country. He aims to provide a framework for understanding the various components of the Japanese state, including the roles of the Emperor, Shogun, and the two classes of nobility (Kuge at the Emperor’s court and Daimyo at the Shogun’s court). Dickson stresses the importance of recognizing the distinctions between these positions and their historical development to grasp the nuances of Japanese history and current affairs.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The Emperor and Imperial Family</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This section delves into the mythology surrounding the Japanese imperial family and their divine ancestry. Dickson explores the historical context of Emperor Jinmu, the first human ruler, and the establishment of the capital in the Kyoto region. He then describes the Emperor’s palace and its structure, highlighting the differences compared to European palaces and emphasizing the symbolic significance of its design. Additionally, Dickson discusses the roles and functions of the “Shi-Sinwo” (four royal families) and their importance in ensuring succession to the throne.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Ranks and Social Hierarchy</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Dickson explains the strict social hierarchy of Japan, where each individual’s rank determines their interactions and expected behavior towards others. He differentiates between the “two-sworded” samurai class, including the Kuge and Daimyo, and the “swordless” commoners, such as merchants, artisans, and farmers. Dickson also delves into the system of ranks and titles, mirroring the Chinese system, and the significance of clan affiliations and family names.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The Eight Boards of Government</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This final section outlines the structure of the Japanese government, modeled after the Chinese system, with eight boards overseeing different aspects of state affairs. Dickson describes each board, including the officials and their responsibilities, highlighting the central role of the “Dai-jo-gwang” (Great Board of Government) and its influence over the other boards. He concludes by noting the shift of executive power from Kyoto to Edo with the rise of the Shogunate, leaving the Kyoto court with a largely symbolic role.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary><p class="jatsi_summary">This collection of letters, published in the Japan Daily Herald between April 1873 and August 1874, offers critical observations on the evolving relationship between Japanese and foreign residents in Japan during the early Meiji period. Written under various pseudonyms, the letters delve into the challenges and frustrations experienced by foreigners due to cultural misunderstandings, perceived Japanese social and business practices, and the conduct of certain foreigners themselves.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Several key themes emerge from the letters. One prominent theme is the perceived decline in respect for foreigners by the Japanese. The authors attribute this decline to various factors, including the behavior of some foreign residents, the rapid rise of inexperienced Japanese officials with limited understanding of foreign cultures and practices, and the deliberate efforts of certain Japanese individuals to exploit foreigners for personal gain.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Another recurring theme is the frustration experienced by foreign professionals employed by the Japanese government. The letters describe instances where these professionals were denied authority, their expertise undervalued, and their ideas appropriated without acknowledgment. This perceived lack of trust and appreciation is seen as hindering progress and contributing to the overall negative sentiment towards foreigners.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Furthermore, the letters address concerns about the influence of Japanese trade guilds and the Machi-Gaisho, a government institution overseeing trade. The authors criticize these entities for perpetuating monopolies, restricting trade, and creating barriers to direct interaction between Japanese and foreign merchants. This, they argue, limits trade opportunities and hinders the economic development of the country.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The letters also offer critiques of the foreign community itself. Authors point to the lack of unity and cooperation among foreign residents, with some individuals prioritizing personal gain over the collective good. This disunity, they argue, weakens the position of foreigners and makes them susceptible to exploitation by the Japanese.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Finally, the letters call for greater awareness and understanding of the cultural differences and challenges inherent in the evolving relationship between Japanese and foreigners. They urge both sides to address their respective shortcomings and work towards building a more equitable and mutually beneficial relationship. The authors emphasize the importance of open communication, good faith, and respect as crucial elements for achieving this goal.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p class="jatsi_sources_author">Ross C. Houghton</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924023537560">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book provides an extensive overview of the lives of women in various Eastern countries during the late 19th century. Houghton, drawing from personal observations during his travels and information gathered from missionaries and other reliable sources, delves into the religious, intellectual, and social aspects that shaped women’s experiences.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book extensively explores the role of religion in dictating women’s place in society. Houghton delves into the major religious systems present in the East, including Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Islam, examining how each faith assigns specific roles and limitations to women, often relegating them to positions of subservience and dependence on men. He highlights the lack of spiritual autonomy for women and the emphasis on their roles as wives and mothers.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Houghton dedicates several chapters to various stages of a woman’s life in the Orient. He describes the cultural practices surrounding childbirth, including the stark contrast between the celebrations for sons and the disappointment or even infanticide of daughters.

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Reverend Isaac William Wiley, a Methodist Episcopal bishop, undertook a missionary journey to China and Japan in 1877-78. His book, <i>China and Japan,</i> chronicles his observations and experiences during this extensive tour, encompassing visits to major cities, mission stations, and rural areas. The text provides insights into the cultures, religions, and daily lives of the people in both countries, with a particular focus on the progress and challenges of Christian missions.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Wiley compares his current observations with his experiences as a missionary physician in Foochow, China, 25 years prior. He highlights the stark changes brought about by increased foreign interaction and trade. He observes the emergence of modern infrastructure like arsenals, shipyards, railroads, and telegraph lines, particularly in Japan, which had undergone rapid modernization efforts under the Meiji Restoration. Despite these advancements, Wiley notes the persistence of traditional practices and deep-rooted cultural values, especially in China.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">A significant portion of the book focuses on the activities of various Protestant missionary societies operating in China and Japan. Wiley details the establishment and growth of mission stations, schools, and hospitals. He emphasizes the dedication and challenges faced by missionaries, including cultural barriers, official resistance, and social stigma associated with conversion. He also praises the piety and commitment of native converts who often face persecution and economic hardship for their faith.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Wiley provides detailed descriptions of the dominant religious systems in both countries. He explores the complexities of Chinese state religion with its veneration of Shang-Ti and ancestral worship, and the widespread influence of Confucianism. He also delves into the popular Buddhist and Taoist traditions, noting their similarities to Roman Catholic practices. In Japan, he examines the indigenous Shinto faith with its reverence for kami (gods) and nature, and the later influence of Buddhism with its various sects and practices.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes with a comparative analysis of the social status and lives of women in both countries. Wiley portrays Chinese women as largely confined to domestic roles, often subject to foot binding and limited educational opportunities. In contrast, he observes greater freedom and social participation among Japanese women, who traditionally receive education and engage in various arts and crafts. However, he emphasizes that women in both societies remain subordinate to men and face various societal constraints.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This volume compiles four sketches that explore various aspects of Japanese life and culture in the late 19th century. House aims to portray the “inner life” of the Japanese people, focusing on social customs, domestic relationships, leisure activities, and the influence of the natural landscape on their character. He notes the lack of detailed accounts of these aspects in existing literature on Japan, which primarily focuses on its artistic products, political history, or interactions with foreign students and dignitaries.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The first sketch, “Little Fountain of Sakanoshita,” is a fictionalized account based on authentic details of rural life in a secluded mountain village. The narrative centers around a young jinrikisha runner and his relationship with the innkeeper’s daughter, Koizumi, against the backdrop of the breathtaking natural beauty of the region. House uses this story to depict the simplicity of rural Japanese society, its economic realities, and the complexities of love and social standing.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The second sketch, “To Fuziyama and Back,” recounts the author’s journey with a group of companions to ascend Mount Fuji. House details the challenges and rewards of the climb, offering practical advice for future tourists and emphasizing the importance of pacing oneself and utilizing available resources. He also describes the unique visual spectacle of the mountain, particularly the transformative effects of sunlight on its snow-capped peak and the expansive views it offers.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">”A Japanese Statesman at Home” details House’s experiences as a guest of Hirosawa Hiosaku, a high-ranking government official. The narrative contrasts two dinner parties: one hosted by the American consul, where Hirosawa and another statesman navigate foreign dining customs, and the other hosted by Hirosawa, offering a traditional Japanese feast and entertainment. Through these events, House sheds light on Japanese social etiquette, culinary practices, family dynamics, and the evolving relationship between Japanese officials and foreigners.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The final sketch, “A Day in a Japanese Theatre,” provides a comprehensive overview of a typical theatrical experience in Tokyo. House describes the physical layout of the theater, the diverse audience, the various types of performances, and the unique stage practices, including the use of onstage musicians, elaborate costumes, and unconventional scene-shifting techniques. He offers observations on the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese acting, noting the skill in portraying strong emotions and the limitations imposed by the absence of female actors and certain technical aspects.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This collection of papers, originally published in the <i>Japan Gazette</i> in 1883, details the author’s multiple journeys throughout the island of Yezo (now Hokkaido) over a twenty-year period. Beginning with his arrival in Hakodate in 1861, the author describes the town’s features, its role as a trading port, and the changes it has undergone since the opening of Japan to foreign commerce. He details the lives of the inhabitants, focusing on their primary occupations of fishing and seaweed harvesting, and provides insights into the dynamics between the Japanese settlers and the indigenous Ainu population.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The papers then delve into various excursions undertaken by the author, encompassing visits to volcanoes like Komagatake and Esan, explorations of the lakes near Hakodate, and journeys along the rugged coastlines of Yezo. Each trip is meticulously documented, with detailed descriptions of the terrain, vegetation, and human settlements encountered. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges of traversing the island’s undeveloped infrastructure, including treacherous mountain paths, unpredictable river crossings, and the ubiquitous presence of dense bamboo scrub.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The author’s travels extend to the remote regions of Yezo, encompassing the south-east coast near Cape Erimo, the eastern settlements of Akis and Nemoro, and the sparsely populated north-east coast leading to Cape Soya, the northernmost point of the island. He recounts his experiences with the Ainu people encountered in these areas, providing observations on their physical appearance, customs, and livelihood primarily based on fishing and occasional small-scale agriculture. The author also delves into the historical context of Yezo, discussing the legacy of the feudal system and the role of various Daimyos in managing different coastal districts prior to the Meiji Restoration.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The papers dedicate significant attention to the development of Yezo under the Kaitakushi, a government department established in 1871 with the aim of colonizing and modernizing the island. The author critiques the department’s policies, highlighting the impracticality of prioritizing agricultural settlements in the interior while neglecting the development of coastal infrastructure and the fishing industry, the primary source of livelihood for the majority of the population. He discusses the establishment of Sapporo as the island’s capital and its rapid growth through government subsidies and infrastructure projects, including the construction of the Otaru-Sapporo railway.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The concluding sections focus on Sapporo and its surroundings, detailing the various agricultural and industrial projects undertaken by the Kaitakushi, including farms, vineyards, orchards, a brewery, and a silk-reeling factory. The author examines the climate and natural features of the region, highlighting its suitability for summer excursions and recreation despite the limitations of infrastructure and social life for foreigners. The papers conclude with reflections on the future development of Yezo, emphasizing the need for a more balanced approach that prioritizes the improvement of transportation networks, harbors, and support for the fishing industry, alongside continued agricultural development.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

Moving beyond simple descriptions, the book delves into the construction methods, interior design, and cultural significance of various house elements. Comparisons with Western, particularly American, houses are frequently made, highlighting the unique characteristics and underlying philosophies of Japanese architecture.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book meticulously details the construction process, emphasizing the use of wood as the primary material. It explains the seemingly precarious foundation system where uprights rest on individual stones and the absence of diagonal bracing. The book describes the careful selection and utilization of wood, highlighting the desire to match grain and color for aesthetic coherence. It also delves into the unique construction of ceilings, often made of thin boards and supported by a hidden suspension system.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Morse examines the interior layout and design principles, focusing on the flexible nature of Japanese rooms achieved through the use of sliding screens (fusuma and shoji) instead of fixed walls. He discusses the significance of tatami mats in defining room size and shaping Japanese social etiquette. The book dedicates significant attention to the tokonoma and chigai-dana, alcoves serving as focal points for displaying art and treasured objects. The emphasis on asymmetry and the incorporation of natural elements in interior design are also explored.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book delves into the specifics of various house components, such as kitchens, closets, staircases, and bathing areas. It highlights the centrality of the hibachi (brazier) in daily life and its role in social gatherings. The cultural importance of cleanliness is underscored through descriptions of bathing customs and the ubiquitous presence of the chodzubachi (water basin) for handwashing. The book also sheds light on household shrines, reflecting the Japanese people’s engagement with both Shinto and Buddhist traditions.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Morse continuously compares Japanese house design and construction with Western practices, particularly those of America and England. He critiques the Western tendency towards excessive ornamentation and clutter, praising the Japanese focus on simplicity, functionality, and the incorporation of nature. He also briefly examines the houses of neighboring regions, including those of the Ainu, Hachijo Islanders, Loochooans, Koreans, and Chinese, noting the unique features and possible influences on the Japanese house.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This travelogue recounts Simon Adler Stern’s five-month journey to China and Japan in 1887, undertaken for business purposes. Stern travelled across the United States by train, noting observations about the changing landscape and towns along his route. He spent several days in San Francisco before embarking on a leisurely voyage across the Pacific Ocean on the steamship San Pablo.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Stern’s first stop was Yokohama, Japan, where he spent several weeks exploring the city and its surroundings, including the bustling streets with their distinctive shops, and the serene beauty of the bay. He took several trips to Tokyo, the capital city, where he visited temples, gardens, and the Exposition building. He also participated in both a European-style dinner and a traditional Japanese dinner, experiencing the cultural differences in etiquette and cuisine.</p>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Percival Lowell’s <i>The Soul of the Far East</i> explores the unique cultural and psychological landscape of Japan, China, and Korea. He posits that these societies, while not savage, exhibit a form of “semi-civilization” characterized by arrested development and a focus on refinement over scientific progress. Lowell emphasizes the concept of “impersonality” as the core of the Far Eastern soul, contrasting it with the Western focus on individuality.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Lowell delves into the family structure of Far Eastern societies, highlighting the centrality of the family unit over the individual. He describes how significant life events, such as birthdays and marriages, are treated with a sense of communal anonymity, further reinforcing the idea of impersonality. Adoption practices, often involving adults and serving primarily genealogical purposes, illustrate the prioritization of family lineage over personal bonds.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Analyzing the Japanese language, Lowell points to the absence of personal pronouns and grammatical gender as evidence of the culture’s impersonal nature. He explores the extensive use of honorifics, which prioritize social standing over individual identity. The structure of sentences, with qualifying words preceding the words they modify and the frequent omission of subjects, further emphasizes the focus on actions and events as impersonal occurrences rather than products of individual agency.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Lowell argues that the Far East’s artistic prowess stems from its deep connection with nature and an aversion to focusing on humanity as the primary subject of art. He contrasts this with the Western emphasis on the human form and the study of the nude, noting that Japanese art prioritizes landscapes and natural elements as sources of inspiration and subjects for depiction. He highlights the importance of simplicity and suggestion in Far Eastern art, exemplified by the prevalence of sketches and the masterful use of brushstrokes.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Lowell examines the religious landscape of the Far East, noting the coexistence of Shintoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. He identifies Buddhism as the most relevant to understanding the concept of impersonality, due to its focus on achieving Nirvana, a state of blissful non-existence where the self dissolves into the universal soul. He contrasts this with Christianity’s emphasis on individual salvation and the continuation of the self in the afterlife, concluding that the Far East’s embrace of impersonality hinders its ability to adopt Western religious beliefs.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

He discusses the challenges of managing a predominantly Japanese staff, acknowledging their growing competency while also highlighting the difficulties of communication and differing approaches to work. He recounts several incidents, including earthquakes, fires, and a deliberate attempt to derail a train, showcasing the risks and unique situations faced by engineers in Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Eight Years in Japan concludes with Holtham’s transfer to Kobe in 1881 and reflections on the evolving landscape for foreign employees within the Japanese government.

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">Occult Japan, or, The Way of the Gods: An Esoteric Study of Japanese Personality and Possession</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">Percival Lowell</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924022940351/page/n9">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary><p class="jatsi_summary">Occult Japan: The Way of the Gods - Summary</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary"><i>Occult Japan: The Way of the Gods</i> by Percival Lowell, published in 1894, delves into the esoteric practices of divine possession within Japanese religious traditions. The book primarily focuses on Shinto, the native faith of Japan, and its lesser-known aspects relating to spirit communication and trance states. Lowell presents his findings through personal observations and interactions with practitioners, offering a detailed account of the rituals and beliefs surrounding this unique cultural phenomenon.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book opens with Lowell’s unexpected encounter with a group performing a possession ritual atop Mount Ontaké, a sacred peak in Japan. This experience leads him to further investigate the widespread practice of divine possession, revealing a complex system deeply embedded in the Japanese psyche. He then provides an overview of Shinto, explaining its historical development, core beliefs, and pantheon of deities. He emphasizes the significance of ancestor worship and the close relationship Japanese people perceive between themselves and the divine.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Lowell delves into the two main categories of occult practices: miracles and incarnations. He describes “miracles” as the manipulation of spirits within objects, exemplified by rituals like the ordeal of boiling water and fire-walking. He explains “incarnations” as the possession of individuals by deities, focusing on the role of purification rituals, trance induction, and communication with the possessing spirits. He distinguishes between Shinto, Ryobu (a hybrid of Shinto and Buddhism), and Buddhist approaches to possession, highlighting the unique characteristics of each.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book dedicates a section to the significance of pilgrimages and pilgrim clubs within the possession cult. Lowell describes the cultural importance of pilgrimages, particularly to sacred mountains like Ontaké, and the role of pilgrim clubs in facilitating these journeys and fostering community engagement with the practice. He emphasizes the distinct characteristics of Ontaké pilgrim clubs, which specifically focus on achieving trance states and interacting with deities.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Finally, Lowell delves into the deeper meaning and implications of the possession cult. He explores the concept of “self” and its connection to personality and individuality, drawing comparisons between Japanese, Western, and feminine perspectives. He theorizes that the prevalence and ease of possession in Japan stems from a cultural tendency toward impersonality and reduced mental activity. He explores the connection between trance states and dreams, suggesting that both involve similar processes of selective attention and altered consciousness. Ultimately, he concludes that Shinto god-possession serves as a genuine manifestation of the ancestral spirit of the Japanese race.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

The book highlights geographical and cultural differences between Australia and America, drawing parallels between the Australian colonies and the pre-Revolution American colonies in terms of their relationship with the “Mother Country.”  Significant attention is given to Australian city life, with descriptions of Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and Ballarat, including a detailed account of a visit to a gold mine.</p>

The book recounts the author’s experiences in Hong Kong and Canton, describing street scenes, temples, the live fish market, a firecracker factory, and the practice of carrying ancestral jars.</p>

The book concludes with a brief summary of Rev. Clark’s experiences in promoting the Christian Endeavor movement around the world, noting successes and challenges encountered in each region.

<p class="jatsi_summary">J. Morris’s <i>What Will Japan Do?</i> offers a speculative analysis of Japan’s potential role in the shifting political landscape of the Far East at the end of the 19th century.

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">Letters Written by the English Residents in Japan, 1611-1623</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">Naojiro Murakami</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/letterswrittenby00mura">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book, edited by N. Murakami and K. Murakawa, compiles letters and documents related to the English trading settlement in Japan during the seventeenth century. It is divided into two parts: the first containing letters by William Adams, the first Englishman to reside in Japan, and the second containing excerpts from W. Noel Sainsbury’s “Calendar of State Papers” concerning Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The first part focuses on William Adams, who arrived in Japan in 1600 as the pilot of a Dutch ship. His letters detail his experiences, including his imprisonment, his rise to prominence under Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, and his role in establishing the English trading factory at Hirado in 1613. The letters also provide insights into Japanese culture, governance, and the complex political landscape of the time. Additionally, they touch upon Adams’ efforts in shipbuilding, navigation, and his aspirations to discover a Northwest Passage from Japan to England.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The second part of the book offers a chronological collection of correspondence between English merchants in Japan and various individuals within the East India Company network. These letters, dating from 1613 to 1623, shed light on the challenges and complexities faced by the English factory at Hirado. They highlight the difficulties in establishing profitable trade, the competition with Dutch merchants, and the strained relationships with Japanese authorities, particularly following the death of Shogun Ieyasu in 1616.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The collection further reveals the internal conflicts and struggles within the English factory. Several letters expose disagreements and tensions between Richard Cocks, the chief merchant, and other members of the factory, including Richard Wickham and William Eaton. Furthermore, the documents expose the challenges faced by the English in securing reliable trade routes and establishing profitable ventures in Siam, Cochin China, and other regions.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes with documentation concerning the eventual closure of the English factory at Hirado in 1623. The reasons for the closure are attributed to a combination of factors, including the lack of profitability, the restrictive trade policies implemented by the Japanese government, and internal discord within the factory. This collection of letters and documents offers a valuable resource for understanding the early interactions between England and Japan and the challenges faced by European trading companies in establishing themselves in East Asia during the seventeenth century.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p class="jatsi_summary">This section delves into the complexities of foreigner-native relations in Japan at the turn of the 20th century. Edwards highlights the underlying tension caused by Japan’s intense patriotism and its historical distrust of foreign influence. He explores the challenges faced by foreign merchants due to boycotts and discriminatory laws, as well as the waning interest in Christianity among the educated classes and the push for secular, nationalist education. Despite these tensions, Edwards acknowledges the inherent courtesy and kindness of the Japanese people, attributing the current friction to the clash between traditional values and the rapid modernization of Japanese society.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary"><i>Part 2: Religious Plays</i></p>

He emphasizes the historical development of Noh, tracing its origins from Shinto rituals and its evolution under Buddhist influence. The essay describes the unique characteristics of Noh performance, including the use of masks, the role of the chorus, and the stylized movements of the actors. Edwards draws parallels between Noh and European religious dramas, noting the reverence for tradition and the focus on spiritual themes.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary"><i>Part 3: Popular Plays</i></p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This section explores the world of Kabuki, the popular form of Japanese theatre that emerged during the Edo period.

He discusses the influence of puppet theatre on Kabuki acting styles and the absence of female actors on the stage. Edwards also delves into the themes prevalent in Kabuki plays, including the importance of duty, loyalty, and filial piety, often expressed through acts of self-sacrifice and even suicide.

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">John La Farge’s <i>An Artist’s Letters from Japan</i> chronicles his travels through Japan in 1886 alongside his friend Henry Adams. The book comprises a series of letters penned during his journey, offering vivid descriptions of the landscapes, architecture, art, and cultural nuances he encounters. La Farge’s observations blend keen artistic analysis with personal reflections, creating a rich tapestry of experiences and insights.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The initial letters depict La Farge’s arrival in Yokohama and his immediate immersion into a world starkly different from his own. He details the unique qualities of Japanese light, the bustling streets of Tokyo, and his first encounters with cultural practices such as jinrikisha travel and traditional theater. Subsequent letters delve into the historical and artistic significance of the Tokugawa Shoguns, focusing on the elaborate temple complexes at Shiba and Uyeno in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">A significant portion of the book centers on La Farge’s extended stay in Nikko, a mountainous region renowned for its natural beauty and the opulent shrines of Shoguns Iyeyasu and Iyemitsu. He provides detailed descriptions of the architectural features, intricate carvings, and symbolic motifs adorning these structures. He reflects on the interplay between the meticulous artistry of the temples and the surrounding natural landscape, highlighting the Japanese philosophy of embracing impermanence and the transient nature of human existence.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">La Farge delves into the philosophical underpinnings of Japanese art, drawing parallels with Chinese Taoist principles. He explores the concept of “Tao” — the Way — and its emphasis on achieving harmony through simplicity and naturalness. He contrasts this approach with Western art’s tendency towards elaborate preparatory work and “advertisement,” arguing that Japanese artists prioritize the “thing itself” and the intrinsic value of craftsmanship over external appearances.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The final letters narrate La Farge’s travels to Kamakura, where he marvels at the Great Buddha statue, and his experiences in Kyoto, a city steeped in history and tradition. He explores the cultural significance of geishas, recounts legendary tales of warriors and emperors, and shares his observations on the evolving social landscape of Japan as it grapples with modernization and Western influences. Throughout his journey, La Farge emphasizes the unique aesthetic sensibilities and deep respect for nature that permeate Japanese art and culture.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p class="jatsi_summary">Progress of India, Japan, and China in the Century: A Summary</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Sir Richard Temple’s <i>Progress of India, Japan, and China in the Century</i> offers a concise overview of the significant transformations experienced by these three Asian nations during the 19th century. Divided into three distinct parts, the book examines the diverse trajectories of development under varying political and social contexts.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Part One focuses on India and the establishment of the British Empire within its borders. It details the gradual conquest and annexation of territories previously held by native powers, such as the Mahrattas and Sikhs, culminating in the formation of a vast and unified empire under British rule. The book then outlines the administrative structures put in place by the British, including the division of territories into presidencies and provinces, the establishment of legal and judicial systems, and the implementation of land revenue settlements. It further explores the impact of British rule on various aspects of Indian society, encompassing infrastructure development, trade and communication, municipal reforms, education, and the introduction of Christianity.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Part Two delves into the unique case of Japan. It begins by outlining the existing feudal system in 1800, characterized by the Shogunate’s leadership and the Emperor’s largely symbolic role. The narrative then explores the impact of Western interaction, particularly the arrival of Commodore Perry and the subsequent signing of commercial treaties, leading to internal discontent and the eventual collapse of the Shogunate. This paved the way for the Meiji Restoration and the modernization of Japan under Emperor Mutsuhito, embracing Western models of government, education, and military organization. The book concludes by examining the state of Japan in 1899, highlighting its rapid “Europeanization” and emerging role as a significant power in the Far East.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Part Three examines the tumultuous trajectory of China in the 19th century. It starts by depicting the seemingly prosperous and powerful empire under Emperor Chien Lung in 1800. However, the narrative quickly reveals the underlying weaknesses of the system, plagued by official corruption, inefficient administration, and a deep-rooted resistance to change. The book chronicles a series of internal rebellions, notably the Taiping Rebellion, and two wars with European powers that exposed the vulnerabilities of the Chinese military and the government’s inability to protect its own interests. The concluding chapters depict the declining state of China in 1899, facing internal unrest and growing foreign intervention, leaving its future uncertain and its imperial authority in tatters.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Summary of “Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things” by Lafcadio Hearn (1904)</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary"><i>Kottō</i> is a collection of short stories and essays exploring Japanese folklore, supernatural beliefs, and cultural practices. The collection draws from various sources, including ancient Japanese storybooks like “Hyaku Monogatari” and “Uji-Shui Monogatari,” alongside Hearn’s own observations and experiences in Japan. The stories range from retellings of traditional ghost stories and folktales to more philosophical and contemplative pieces on the nature of life, death, and the afterlife.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The first section of the book, titled “Old Stories,” features nine tales focusing primarily on traditional ghost stories and supernatural phenomena. These include accounts of vengeful spirits, mysterious encounters, and inexplicable occurrences rooted in Japanese folklore. For instance, “The Legend of Yurei-Daki” tells the story of a woman who encounters a ghostly voice while seeking a shrine’s money box, only to discover a tragic consequence upon returning home.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The second part of the book delves into various aspects of Japanese culture and belief systems. “A Woman’s Diary” offers a poignant and intimate glimpse into the life of a common woman in Meiji-era Japan, chronicling her arranged marriage, joys, sorrows, and struggles with child mortality. Other pieces like “Heike-gani” explore the influence of folklore on the natural world, discussing the legend of crabs bearing the faces of fallen samurai warriors.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Hearn also delves into the more philosophical and spiritual dimensions of Japanese culture. In “Fireflies,” he moves beyond the scientific explanation of bioluminescence to explore the cultural significance of fireflies in Japanese folklore and poetry. He presents various folk names for different species of fireflies and discusses the tradition of firefly hunting, both as a childhood pastime and a means of livelihood.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Throughout the collection, Hearn’s writing is characterized by a fascination with the supernatural and a deep respect for Japanese culture. He meticulously portrays the nuances of Japanese customs and beliefs, offering Western readers a unique window into the complexities of the Japanese worldview. The stories and essays in <i>Kottō</i> evoke a sense of mystery and wonder, inviting contemplation on the nature of reality, the afterlife, and the interconnectedness of all things.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This travelogue details the author’s journeys through Japan, focusing on both the natural beauty of the country and observations of Japanese culture and society.

<p class="jatsi_summary">The book emphasizes the deep connection between Japanese art and the natural world.

<p class="jatsi_summary">Rittner delves into the social structures and customs of Japan, exploring the roles of men and women within the family unit.

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book explores the complexities of Japanese culture and society through the lens of its religious beliefs and practices. Hearn emphasizes the challenge of understanding Japan for Westerners due to the deeply ingrained nature of its traditions and the unique psychological development of its people. He argues that comprehending Japanese religion is crucial to gaining any genuine insight into the nation’s social structures, artistic expressions, and literary traditions.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Hearn details the initial impression of strangeness that Japan evokes in Westerners, highlighting the unfamiliar aesthetics, behaviors, and language. He notes the “antipodal” nature of many Japanese actions, suggesting a historical and evolutionary difference rather than an inherent incompatibility. Despite the initial shock, Hearn finds beauty and sophistication in Japanese craftsmanship, design, and resourcefulness, recognizing the historical depth and value of their culture.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The core of the book delves into the central role of ancestor worship in Japanese society, categorized under the umbrella term “Shinto.” Hearn outlines the three main forms of Shinto: the Domestic Cult (family ancestors), the Communal Cult (local or clan ancestors), and the State Cult (Imperial ancestors). He traces the evolution of these cults from early burial rites and spirit propitiation to the establishment of household shrines and complex rituals.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Hearn explores the social implications of ancestor worship, particularly its influence on family structure and the concept of filial piety. He draws parallels with ancient European societies, noting similarities in family hierarchies, inheritance laws, and the emphasis on duty and obedience. The book examines the expectations placed upon individuals within the family unit, including arranged marriages, adoption practices, and the subservient role of women.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book further explores the impact of Buddhism on Japan, highlighting its role in introducing new ethical concepts like kindness to animals and the doctrine of Karma.

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book, edited by Karl Kiyoshi Kawakami, presents a collection of excerpts from foreign authors writing about Japan before the Russo-Japanese War. It aims to provide a balanced perspective on Japan, encompassing both praise and criticism, without the editor’s personal evaluation or judgment.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The collection reflects a wide range of viewpoints on Japanese culture, society, and character. Many authors, like Lafcadio Hearn and Sir Edwin Arnold, express admiration for the aesthetics of Japanese life, the refinement of its art forms, and the gentle and courteous nature of its people. The book explores various aspects of Japanese culture, including painting, poetry, architecture, gardening, and the unique social custom of “go-inkyo” (retirement).</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">However, the collection doesn’t shy away from critiques of Japanese society. Several authors point out the lack of emphasis on individual expression in art and literature, the challenges faced by women in a patriarchal society, and the perceived lack of commercial morality among Japanese merchants. There are also observations on the rapid modernization and Westernization of Japan, with some authors expressing concern about the erosion of traditional values and the potential for a more aggressive Japan on the world stage.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book delves into the complexities and apparent contradictions in Japanese character. The seemingly paradoxical nature of the Japanese people is highlighted, with their capacity for both deep introspection and superficiality, their artistic sensitivity alongside stoicism and capacity for violence, and their rapid action contrasting with a tendency for procrastination.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Overall, <i>Japan and the Japanese</i> offers a valuable historical snapshot of foreign perceptions of Japan at a pivotal moment in its history. It showcases the beauty and intricacies of Japanese culture while acknowledging its flaws and challenges, providing a multifaceted view of a nation in transition.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary"><i>The New Far East</i> offers an overview of the political and social landscapes of Japan, China, and Korea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Written in 1898 and reissued in 1904 with an updated preface, the book provides insights into the changing dynamics of the region following Japan’s victory in the Sino-Japanese War. Diosy, Chairman of the Council of the Japan Society in London, approaches the subject from a decidedly pro-Japanese perspective.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The text examines the contrasting trajectories of Japan and China, highlighting Japan’s rapid modernization and emergence as a military power in stark opposition to China’s perceived stagnation and corruption. Diosy details the impact of Western influences on Japan, particularly in areas such as dress, education, and military organization. He portrays the Japanese as eager learners and skilled adaptors, successfully integrating Western advancements into their society while retaining their unique national spirit.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Diosy contrasts this progress with the seemingly intractable problems plaguing China, attributing the nation’s weaknesses to its entrenched bureaucracy and deeply ingrained traditional values resistant to change.  He criticizes the inefficiency and venality of Chinese officials and laments the lack of genuine reform efforts.  The author also scrutinizes Western interactions with China, arguing that European powers are primarily driven by self-interest and fail to understand the true needs of the Chinese people.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary"><i>The New Far East</i> delves into specific aspects of Japanese society, including the role of women, the burgeoning industrial sector, and the national character’s perceived strengths and weaknesses.  Diosy also explores the impact of Western commercial and financial interests in Japan, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges presented by foreign investment.  He argues that Japan’s progress necessitates attracting foreign capital while safeguarding national independence.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Concluding with a call for a clear and decisive British policy in the Far East, Diosy advocates for a strong Anglo-Japanese alliance to counter Russian expansionism and ensure regional stability.  He contends that Britain, by recognizing and supporting Japan’s growing power, can secure its own interests and contribute to a peaceful and prosperous future for the New Far East.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes by examining the challenges faced by Christian missionaries in Japan.

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book delves into the history of the Japanese people, with a particular focus on their educational journey. Scherer divides the book into three sections, each representing a distinct phase of Japan’s development: “Early Culture,” “Adolescence,” and “Modern School-Days.”</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Early Culture explores Japan’s formative years, from its mythological origins and the legendary Emperor Jimmu to the introduction of Chinese civilization in the 6th century. Scherer highlights the influence of Shinto, the native religion centered around ancestor worship and aesthetics, and the subsequent adoption of Buddhism and Confucianism. He emphasizes the impact of these belief systems on Japanese culture, social structure, and early forms of education, primarily led by Buddhist monasteries.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Adolescence focuses on the period of Chinese influence, spanning from the 6th to the mid-19th century. Scherer details the rise and fall of powerful families like the Fujiwara and the Tokugawa, who established the Shogunate system of government with a military leader alongside the Emperor. He examines the flourishing of classical literature and various art forms, including poetry, prose, painting, and metalwork, attributing much of this artistic development to Buddhist patronage. The section concludes with the arrival of Europeans and the subsequent persecution of Christians, leading to Japan’s self-imposed isolation.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Modern School-Days chronicles Japan’s rapid transformation after Commodore Perry’s arrival in 1853 forced the nation to open its doors to the West. Scherer describes the collapse of the Shogunate, the restoration of imperial power, and the Meiji period’s embrace of Westernization. He details the crucial role of education in this process, highlighting the influence of figures like Guido Verbeck and Fukuzawa Yukichi. The book concludes with an overview of Japan’s modern education system, its strengths and weaknesses, and the ongoing struggle between materialism and moral development.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Scherer’s writing reflects the perspective of his time, with some potentially outdated or biased views on Japanese culture and character. The book offers a valuable historical account of Japan’s educational evolution and provides context for understanding the nation’s modernization efforts.

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">Shinto: The Ancient Religion of Japan</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">W. G. Aston</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/shintotheancient00asto">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book provides an overview of Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, focusing on its ancient form before significant influence from Buddhism and Confucianism. Aston utilizes early Japanese texts like the Kojiki and Nihongi, alongside the ritual compendium Yengishiki, to paint a picture of Shinto beliefs and practices.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Aston explains the core concept of “Kami,” often translated as “god,” but encompassing a broader range of beings and entities deserving reverence. He emphasizes the importance of Nature-gods, personifications of natural phenomena and elements, as the primary deities in the Shinto pantheon. While acknowledging the presence of deified humans and ancestral figures, Aston argues that they play a secondary role compared to the prominent Nature-gods like the Sun-goddess Amaterasu and the Earth-god Ohonamochi.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book delves into Japanese mythology, recounting key narratives such as the creation myth involving Izanagi and Izanami, the conflict between the Sun-goddess and the Rain-storm god Susa-no-wo, and the descent of the imperial lineage from the heavens. Aston highlights the explanatory nature of these myths, often serving to account for natural phenomena, rituals, and the origins of the ruling class.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Aston further explores the rituals and practices of Shinto, emphasizing the importance of offerings and purification rites. He details ceremonies like the Ohonihe (offering of first fruits), the Nihiname (harvest festival), and the Ohoharahi (great purification). The book also touches upon divination methods, inspiration, and the role of priests and priestesses in Shinto worship.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Finally, the book discusses the later evolution of Shinto and its interaction with Buddhism and Confucianism. Aston explores the syncretic Ryobu Shinto and the “Revival of Pure Shinto” movement in the 18th and 19th centuries. He concludes by suggesting that despite attempts at revitalization, Shinto faces an uncertain future due to its lack of a codified moral system and the influence of other, more complex religious and philosophical systems.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">The Future of Japan, with a Survey of Present Conditions</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">W. Petrie Watson</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924023497674">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book presents a comprehensive analysis of the Japanese state and society at the turn of the 20th century, focusing on the dramatic changes Japan underwent during the Meiji Restoration and its adoption of Western civilization. Watson emphasizes the stark contrast between the modernized, progressive leadership and the largely traditional populace still steeped in the customs and beliefs of the feudal era. He argues that this modernization, driven by the intellectual elite rather than popular demand, has resulted in a unique situation with significant implications for Japan’s future.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Watson delves into various aspects of Japanese society, highlighting the prevalence of contradictions and inconsistencies. He notes the incongruity of a nation renowned for its artistic refinement and stoic heroism also exhibiting commercial dishonesty and a lack of individual initiative. He attributes these contradictions to the rapid and imposed nature of modernization, where traditional social structures and ingrained habits persist despite the adoption of Western institutions and technologies.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The author identifies a significant void in the Japanese psyche: the absence of absolute religious dogma, a cornerstone of Western civilization. He contrasts the Japanese religions of Buddhism and Shintoism, which lack definitive doctrines and emphasize ritual and superstition, with the dogmatic structure of Christianity. He argues that this absence of dogma has led to a materialistic outlook, focusing on practical benefits and political utility rather than spiritual or metaphysical truths.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Watson examines the philosophical landscape of Japan through the lens of Fukuzawa Yukichi, a prominent thinker who advocated for individual independence and self-respect while maintaining a materialist view of the universe. He argues that Fukuzawa’s teachings, while aligned with some aspects of Western thought, ultimately fall short of a comprehensive philosophical system due to the lack of a unifying principle like a universal God or an overarching law of evolution.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes by exploring the future challenges facing Japan, particularly the tension between its quasi-divine Emperor and the burgeoning constitutional system. Watson predicts that the inevitable rise of individualism and political awareness among the populace will ultimately erode the religious authority of the Emperor and the State, forcing Japan to seek a new moral and spiritual foundation for its evolving civilization. He suggests that Christianity, particularly the compelling personality of Christ, may offer a potential solution to this future crisis.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This travelogue details the author’s experiences and observations during a journey through Ceylon, India, China, and Japan in the early 20th century. Penfield provides descriptions of major cities such as Colombo, Kandy, Bombay, Jeypore, Agra, Benares, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Canton, and Macao. He dedicates significant portions of the book to specific topics including the pearl fisheries of Ceylon, the Taj Mahal, the Hindu religion, and the unique social structure of the Parsee community in Bombay.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book intertwines historical information and cultural context with Penfield’s personal anecdotes and encounters. He describes the impact of British colonialism on the regions he visits, highlighting the stark contrast between the lives of Europeans and the native populations. Penfield also delves into the cultural practices and religious beliefs of various groups, including the Buddhists of Ceylon, the Hindus of India, and the Parsees of Bombay. He pays particular attention to the rituals and traditions surrounding death in these cultures, offering detailed accounts of cremation ceremonies and the Parsee Towers of Silence.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">A recurring theme throughout the book is Penfield’s concern for the lack of American commercial presence in the East. He emphasizes the missed opportunities for trade and criticizes the United States’ reliance on foreign vessels for transporting goods. Penfield draws comparisons between the Suez and the then-under-construction Panama Canal, arguing that the latter will not be profitable without the development of a strong American merchant marine.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The final chapter focuses on Japan’s emerging role as a major power in the East. Penfield acknowledges Japan’s limited natural resources but emphasizes the nation’s ambition and drive for industrial and commercial expansion. He highlights the Japanese people’s thirst for knowledge and their focus on education, particularly in learning English. Penfield concludes by suggesting that while Japan may become a significant competitor in the Asian market, its reliance on American raw materials will likely lead to a mutually beneficial economic partnership.</p>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">A. Gorton Angier, editor of the <i>London and China Telegraph</i> and <i>London and China Express,</i> presents a series of essays based on his travels throughout the Far East in 1907. The book is divided into four parts, each focusing on a distinct region: Malaya, China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Part I examines Malaya, encompassing the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States, North Borneo, Siam, and Manila.  Angier provides details of economic development, infrastructural advancements (including railways and harbor works), and the changing social and political landscape in each territory.  He highlights the growing importance of rubber cultivation alongside the established tin industry and discusses the changing dynamics between colonial administrations and native populations.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Part II offers a comprehensive exploration of China, covering Hong Kong, the Yangtze River ports, Tsingtao, Tientsin, and Peking.

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">The Social Evil in Japan and Allied Subjects: With Statistics, Social Evil Test Cases, and Progress of the Antibrothel Movement</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">U. G. Murphy</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/socialevilinjapa00murp">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The 1908 book <i>The Social Evil in Japan and Allied Subjects</i> by U. G. Murphy provides an in-depth examination of the licensed prostitution system in Japan in the early 20th century. The book begins by tracing the origins of the system to 1872 when it was introduced on the advice of a British Army surgeon to regulate prostitution and prevent the spread of venereal diseases.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Murphy details the general features of the licensed prostitution system, including the segregation of brothels, medical examinations of prostitutes, and police registration and supervision. He discusses the sale of young girls into prostitution by their families, often to pay off debts, and how the licensing system perpetuates this practice.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book explores the effects of the system on those connected with it, including brothel keepers, procurers, and the prostitutes themselves. Murphy argues that the system leads to the exportation of Japanese women for prostitution abroad and an increase in crimes against women domestically. He also examines the relationship between licensing and the spread of venereal diseases.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">A significant portion of the book is dedicated to the “Free Cessation Movement” which sought to allow prostitutes to leave the trade of their own volition. Murphy chronicles several legal battles that took place as part of this movement and the various attempts by brothel keepers and their allies to thwart these efforts.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes with an overview of the state of the licensed prostitution system in Japan circa 1908. Murphy argues that while the Free Cessation Movement achieved some successes, the fundamental nature of the system remained unchanged. He calls for further reforms, such as changes to the laws around prostitution contracts and debts, to reduce the exploitation of women. Murphy ultimately advocates for the abolition of the licensed prostitution system altogether.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">Japanese Life in Town and Country</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">George William Knox</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/japaneselifeinto00knox_0/page/n11">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book presents an overview of Japanese society and culture at the turn of the 20th century, focusing on the period following the Meiji Restoration and the opening of Japan to the West. Knox, an American missionary with fifteen years of experience in Japan, emphasizes the need to understand the historical and cultural context to accurately interpret modern Japanese life. He argues against the notion that the East is inherently inscrutable to the West, instead advocating for studying the historical and philosophical foundations of Japanese society to better comprehend its contemporary expressions.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Knox explores the traditional origin stories of Japan and its people, contrasting them with the understanding provided by modern historical and linguistic research. He then delves into the transformative impact of Chinese civilization on Japan, particularly from the 6th century AD onwards. This influence extended to various aspects of Japanese society, including religion, language, law, education, and art. However, Knox notes that despite the adoption of Chinese models, Japan retained its unique characteristics and adapted these foreign influences to its own needs.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book delves into the centuries of feudal warfare that followed the height of Chinese influence, culminating in the Tokugawa Shogunate’s establishment of a rigid social hierarchy and isolationist policy. Knox examines the development of the samurai class, whose ideals of loyalty, learning, and martial prowess formed the core of Japanese identity. He argues that while the feudal system fostered national unity and a sense of patriotism, it also limited progress and necessitated contact with external forces for further development.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book then explores the forced opening of Japan by Commodore Perry and the subsequent social and political upheaval that led to the Meiji Restoration. Knox analyzes the factors contributing to the fall of the Tokugawa regime and the rise of a new generation of samurai leaders who embraced Western knowledge and technology. He emphasizes the crucial role played by foreign advisors and missionaries in the modernization of Japan, while also noting the Japanese determination to ultimately control their own affairs.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The latter part of the book examines various aspects of daily life in Japan, including religious practices, social customs, and the roles of different classes such as farmers, artisans, merchants, and servants. Knox offers insights into the complexities of Japanese language and literature, as well as the challenges and successes of the modern education system. He concludes by emphasizing the dynamic nature of Japanese society, highlighting the tensions between tradition and modernity and the ongoing quest for a place among the leading nations of the world.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">The Arts of Japan</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">Edward Dillon</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/artsofjapan00dilluoft">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Edward Dillon’s <i>The Arts of Japan</i> provides a comprehensive overview of Japanese art history, covering painting, sculpture, and various minor arts. Dillon emphasizes the need to approach Japanese art with an understanding of its unique cultural context and critical standards, particularly the significance of brushwork and the influence of Zen Buddhism. He also acknowledges the challenges of studying Japanese art due to the scarcity of early works in Western collections and the limitations of traditional art historical narratives.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Early Periods and Influences: Dillon explores the prehistoric art of Japan as evidenced by artifacts from dolmen tombs, noting the advanced pottery techniques and the presence of Chinese and even Sassanian influences. The introduction of Buddhism in the 6th and 7th centuries marks a turning point, with art primarily serving religious purposes. Dillon discusses the Nara and Fujiwara periods, highlighting the influence of Chinese art and the development of distinct Japanese styles in painting and sculpture, such as the Kose, Takuma, and Kasuga schools.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The Rise of Landscape and Zen Aesthetics: The Kamakura and Ashikaga periods witness the rise of the samurai class and the flourishing of Buddhist sculpture, exemplified by Unkei and his school. The Zen sect’s emphasis on meditation and contemplation of nature leads to the emergence of landscape painting as a distinct genre, with Sesshiu as a key figure. Dillon also examines the influence of Zen aesthetics on the development of the tea ceremony and its subsequent impact on various arts, particularly ceramics.</p>

<p class="jatsi_sources_title">The Shinto Cult: A Christian Study of the Ancient Religion of Japan</p>
<p class="jatsi_sources_author">Milton Spenser Terry</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/shintocultachri00terrgoog">Main page</a></p>
<details><summary>Summary</summary><p class="jatsi_summary">
<p class="jatsi_summary">This book explores Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, from a Christian perspective. Terry delves into the origins and beliefs of Shinto, drawing upon primary sources like the Ko-ji-ki and Nihongi, as well as secondary materials and scholarly analyses. He examines the core tenets of Shinto, including ancestor worship and animism, and their manifestations in domestic, communal, and national practices. Rituals, such as the Harvest Service and the Great Purification ceremony, are described in detail, offering insight into the nature of Shinto worship and its emphasis on purity and propitiation.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Terry traces the historical development of Shinto, highlighting the significant influence of Confucianism and Buddhism on its evolution. He details the merging of these belief systems and the resulting rise of Ry\305\215bu Shinto (“two parts Shinto”) which dominated Japanese religious life for centuries. Further, he examines the revival of “pure Shinto” in the 18th and 19th centuries and the subsequent disestablishment of Buddhism as the state religion. He also touches upon the existence of esoteric Shinto practices involving mystic rituals and divine possession.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The author then compares Shinto with Christianity, identifying several key differences. He notes the absence of a singular, supreme God in Shinto and its lack of a clear concept of sin as a moral failing. Additionally, he criticizes the lower status of women in Japanese society and the seemingly lesser value placed on individual human life. Terry argues that these aspects necessitate the introduction of Christian teachings to address the shortcomings of Shinto.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Despite these differences, Terry suggests that certain elements within Shinto can find fulfillment in Christian principles. He proposes that the Shinto emphasis on physical and spiritual purity aligns with Christian teachings on holiness and moral uprightness. Furthermore, the animistic belief in spiritual presence within nature can be understood as a precursor to the Christian concept of divine immanence. He envisions a future where Shinto traditions adapt to encompass Christian truths, leading to a more comprehensive and morally sound religious framework for Japan.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes with a reflection on the potential impact of Japan’s rising prominence on the world stage. Terry speculates that Japan’s demonstrably strong ethical principles, evidenced in its recent political and military actions, may serve as a model for other nations, including those that identify as Christian. He expresses hope that Japan’s influence will contribute to a future characterized by peace, justice, and universal understanding.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>

<details><summary>Summary</summary>
<p class="jatsi_summary">Joseph H. Longford’s <i>The Story of Old Japan</i> provides a comprehensive narrative of Japanese history, spanning from the nation’s mythical origins to the restoration of Emperor Mutsuhito in 1867. The book draws heavily from translations of classical Japanese texts such as the Kojiki and Nihongi, offering insights into Japanese mythology and the early, often legendary, periods of the nation’s history. Longford further incorporates European accounts, notably from Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company, to illuminate the interactions between Japan and the West during the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The narrative is divided into three distinct phases. The initial section delves into Japanese mythology, detailing the creation myths and the divine lineage of the emperors, culminating in the reign of Jimmu Tenno, the first emperor, in 660 B.C. Longford then explores the subsequent “dark ages”, a period marked by the gradual expansion of the Japanese state and ongoing conflicts with the indigenous Ainu population. This era witnessed the introduction of Chinese cultural and religious influences, including the adoption of Buddhism and the development of a more complex social structure.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The third phase of the narrative focuses on the rise and fall of powerful families such as the Fujiwara, Taira, Minamoto, Hōjō, and Ashikaga, who alternately exerted control over the emperors and shaped the course of Japanese history for centuries. Longford recounts the dramatic events of the Gempei War and the attempted Mongol invasion, highlighting figures like the legendary warrior Yoshitsune and the influential Hōjō regents. He also examines the impact of the Ashikaga Shogunate on the flourishing of Japanese art and culture, particularly painting and the Noh theatre.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The latter portion of the book delves into the turbulent 16th and 17th centuries, a period of renewed civil war and the arrival of European traders and missionaries. Longford details the rise of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who unified the country and laid the groundwork for the Tokugawa Shogunate. He also explores the initial success and subsequent persecution of Christianity, culminating in the Shimabara Rebellion and the imposition of national seclusion under the Tokugawa regime.</p>
<p class="jatsi_summary">The book concludes with the decline of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the events leading to the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Longford describes the impact of Western pressure on Japan’s isolationist policies, highlighting the roles of Commodore Perry and Townsend Harris in opening the country to foreign trade. He further chronicles the internal political struggles and the rise of the “Sonnō Jōi” (“Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians”) movement, which ultimately led to the fall of the Tokugawa and the restoration of imperial rule.</p><button onclick="this.parentElement.removeAttribute('open');">Close</button></details>
