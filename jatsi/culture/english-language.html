<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">I was fortunate enough to sit next Higono-kami at lunch, and we employed ourselves making a vocabulary on his fan. Though he had never seen a foreigner, until within the last few months, in his life, he could write in the English character, and was very quick in picking up and retaining the correct pronunciation of every vowel I told him. He informed me that he was qualifying himself to be appointed one of the Ambassadors to be sent to Europe, and anxious, in consequence, to lose no opportunity of learning English. I saw him almost every day during the remainder of my stay in Yedo, and he generally used to repeat without a mistake the lesson of the day before. He was infinitely more interested in studying English than in watching the progress of the negotiations, and carried perpetually about in his bosom a stock of fans, which contained his vocabulary. At luncheon, however, he generally contrived to combine duty with inclination, and having carefully noted the name of each dish, forthwith proceeded to partake of it.</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">The lieutenant-governor [of Hakodate] was a young man, of a very fine, sharp, and cunning cast of countenance. The others were very fat, good-natured <i>bons vivants.</i> The interpreter, who spoke English tolerably, was permitted, on the application of the captain, to partake of some refreshment in the presence of his august master. These interpreters are cunning rascals, and need be, to have to explain the most disagreeable truths in such a way as not to offend their superiors. I had reason to know in many instances that they do not half translate what is said; sometimes because they do not quite understand it, in which case they invent, and at other times because they dare not communicate the truth. Thus both parties are for the present in their hands. Most of the consulates have, however, an interpreter of their own, either a native Japanese, or a European who can speak the Dutch language, which most of the interpreters speak well. English is, however, now become the official language in transacting business with the Government.</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">The external trade of Japan is, and seems likely to continue to be, in English hands. Yokohama and Hiogo are English towns. The Chinese are gaining ground in the treaty ports, but the Chinese influence in these days is the influence of England in another shape. In spite of the use of the Chinese character by the cultivated Japanese, the language of trade, as between the Chinese and Japanese in the treaty ports, is the English tongue. Many of the Chinese merchants are English subjects, coming as they do from Hong Kong. Moreover, and above all, the political influences of England and of America combine to lead the Japanese to the use of English as the official language.</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">“Teach us to write English, and teach us cheaply,” is the cry of young Japanese who hope some day to unlock the doors of Tokio officialdom with this magic key of language. Now one may safely economise, if economise one must, on shoes, or <i>saké,</i> or cigarettes, but never on foreign tongues—or one defeats one’s own ends, which is exactly what Our Little Brown Allies have done. According to an inflexible law, supply is regulated by demand, and when demand is for schools where students can learn for fifty sen a month each, the supply is exactly fifty sen worth of phrases. Personal attention could not possibly be included for the price, as even the poorest of teachers must take large classes in order to keep themselves alive, and they have no time to push or pull a backward pupil over the rough places. If he stumbles he must pick himself up as quickly as may be and run after the others, extracting his fifty sen worth as best he can. The lucky youths with nimble brains succeed fairly well; the unlucky ones, with dull brains, struggle after them nobly but ineffectually, filling as many years as they can afford with blackboards and grammars and copybooks.</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">Takaki had received a modern education (they teach English in the Hikone schools, as you find out from the small boys, who shout A B C after you in the streets); but he had not got beyond the word “Yes,” beginning every sentence with it and then lapsing into Japanese.</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">The traveller finds evidence of a desire to learn English existing on all sides, and the Japanese already know more English than do our Indian subjects. ... At all the temples receiving State aid are English and French inscriptions warning visitors not to fish in the ponds, and not to shoot birds in the trees, even where the temples are situated in parts of the interior seldom visited by foreigners, and never by any who cannot understand Japanese. The English of Japan is not at present very good. There are two guide-books to the ancient capital, Kiyoto, written in English by Japanese. The one calls Buddhas “idles,” and the other calls them “idoles.” Among the statements in these books are the following:—“It had been burnt to the ground by thunderlight twenty-nine years ago.” “Biyodoin:—it was in this temple that a most brave general named Yorimasa suicided there 694 years ago.” “Mumenomiya was built for honour of a virtious person—at ancient, one thousand and twenty-six years ago.” “Narabigaoka is named so because the hills stand very peticulairly after one another.”</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">The attempts at English on the signboards in the Ginza and other streets of Tokyo are very amusing. “Wine, beer and other medicines”; “A shop, the kind of umbrella, parasol or stick”; “The shop for the furniture of the several countries”; “Prices, no increase or diminish”; “All kinds of superior sundries kept here”; “Skin maker and seller” (portmanteau shop); “Ladies furnished in the upstair.” These are a few specimens; and I always knew we were getting near to S. Andrew’s House when we passed “Washins and ironins carefully done.”</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">English is spoken very extensively in all the principal cities, and the principal bazaars and shops exhibit signs in Japanese with English translations, some of which are very ludicrous because of the mistakes in spelling, etc. In fact, English, as she is Japped, forms quite an interesting study; and I append a few specimens:</p><br>
<p class="jatsi_textcenter">“The improved milk.”</p>
<p class="jatsi_textcenter">“The European monkey jacket make for the Japanese.”</p>
<p class="jatsi_textcenter">“Carver and Gilder for sale.”</p>
<p class="jatsi_textcenter">“Draper, milliner and ladies’ outfatter.” ...</p><br>
<p class="jatsi_textcenter">“NOTIES.</p>
<p class="jatsi_poem">“Our tooth is a very important organ for human life and countenance as you know; therefore, when it is attack by disease or injury, artificial tooth is also very useful.”</p>
<p class="jatsi_poem">“I am engage to the Dentistry and I will make for your purpose.”</p>

<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">The days of picturesque signboards are over. No longer are we told—certainly not in Tokyo—that “ladies” can be “furnished in the upstairs,” or that the stock-in-trade of an egg-shop is “extract of fowl.” It is true that there is not far from my gate a mysterious legend which announces that the shop, which is full of wood-carvings, is for “The Trading and Manufacturing of Grocers.” This is a belated survival, and it has had the grace to appear in letters of gold on a plate-glass window front. Years ago a student asked me to write him a sign in English suitable for a boot shop, and I wrote him one hurriedly with pencil on a sheet of paper. Next week the whole town could see my neat little handwriting enlarged and parodied—and I had even written “boots and shoes” without capital letters! But it has gone now, and so has the sign “Prefend Cake and Humest Shert,” which was taken down a few days after a young lady of my acquaintance had been into the shop to ask for one.</p>
