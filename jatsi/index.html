<h3>Descriptions of Japan by American and British visitors in the 19th and early 20th centuries</h3>


<p class="jatsi_base_paragraph">When Japan opened to the outside world in the mid-19th century, people in the West were curious about this previously little-known country. Many foreign visitors and long-term residents tried to satisfy that curiosity by publishing written accounts of their stays. <i>Japan As They Saw It</i> collects excerpts from those accounts. The excerpts are grouped into seven broad categories:
<ul>
	<li><a href="japan/index.html">Japan</a></li>
	<li><a href="people/index.html">People</a></li>
	<li><a href="culture/index.html">Culture</a></li>
	<li><a href="economy/index.html">Economy</a></li>
	<li><a href="government/index.html">Government</a></li>
	<li><a href="nature/index.html">Nature</a></li>
	<li><a href="places/index.html">Places</a></li>
</ul>
Each category is divided into subcategories. A full list appears in the <a href="about/contents.html">Contents</a>. Readers are encouraged to browse as their interests take them.</p>
